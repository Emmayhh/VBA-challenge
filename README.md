Module2 Challenges, Stock


This file contains three years of the stock market; each year has a different ticker symbol, opening value, closing value, highest and lowest value, and total value. My script is a small summary table of Yearly change, Percent Change, and Total Stock Volume for each ticker for each year through VBA, and after sorting it out, I calculated the Greatest % Increase, decrease, and The summary table makes it easier to see the situation of the stock market and the situation of each Ticker in each year.
